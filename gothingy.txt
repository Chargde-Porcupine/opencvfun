What needed to find pos in go board
-Assume that the whole image is go board, nothing else is added
-Know space in pixels between crosses
-know buffer from start of board to grid



A = 1 [cos θ1  sin θ1]   b = |r1|   X = |x|
    2 [cos θ2  sin θ2]       |r2|       |y|

solve for x:
-Adject of A and Determinant of A
Together: A Inv = Adjunt of A / Determinant of A

x=((st2*r1-st1*r2)/d);
y=((-ct2*r1+ct1*r2)/d);



x y  r
2 3  8
4 5  7

det = -2

Adj = 
5 -3
-4 2
